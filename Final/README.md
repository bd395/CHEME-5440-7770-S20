#### Problem 1
``Written_Work.pdf`` <br />
``prob1b.jl`` (includes ``phasePortrait.jl``) <br />
``plot1b.png``: Phase portrait (D2 vs D1)

#### Problem 2

``prob2d.jl`` <br />
``plot2db.png``: Normalized Mitotic Rate vs Z (m)

#### Problem 3 (contained within ``P3`` folder)
``Written_Work.pdf`` <br />
``Parameters.toml``: Parameters file (units and source) - I wasn't able to install TOML properly so parameters are displayed here and hardcoded into the main file. <br />
``prob3.ipynb`` (Julia Ipython) <br />
``plot3b.png``: Kp = 1 <br />
``plot3c.png``: Kp = 1, 10, 100

#### Problem 4 (contained within ``P4`` folder)
``Written_Work.pdf`` <br />
``prob4.ipynb`` (Julia Ipython) <br />
``plot4c.png``: Rate (Model and Measured) (mM/h) vs 3'-5'-AMP (mM)  <br />
``Data-3-5-AMP.txt``: Data file
